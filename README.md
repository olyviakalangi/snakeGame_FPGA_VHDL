• System Analyst: Responsible for conducting Snake game system requirements analysis. The system analyst will design the system functional specifications and determine the appropriate hardware specifications.                                                                                                                     
• Hardware Designer: Responsible for designing the schematic and layout of the hardware system. The hardware designer will build the Xilinx FPGA hardware suite and determine the features needed for implementing the Snake game.                                                                                                          
• Firmware Designer: Responsible for writing the VHDL code for the Snake game. The firmware designer will write the code to process the data and update the game's appearance on the screen.
